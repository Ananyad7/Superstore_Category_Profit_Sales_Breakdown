This dynamic Tableau dashboard allows users to click on categories to explore country-wise sales and profits. Key performance indicators (KPIs) for sales and profits compare current and previous years, showing percentage changes. Among the three categories—Furniture, Office Supplies, and Technology—Furniture led with the highest sales of $459k, a 21% increase from the previous year. Office Supplies showed the highest sales jump of 40% from the previous year, while Office Supplies' profit increased the most by almost 26%.
# Breakdown by Furniture category:
1) Australia, China, India, Japan, and Indonesia exceeded the average sales of $25k.
2) China, India, Japan, and Australia generated significant profits exceeding $2k.
3) However, Philippines had higher sales but negative profit, while Thailand had decent sales but the most negative profit.
# Breakdown by Office Supplies category:
1) Australia, China, India, Japan, and Indonesia surpassed the average sales of $14k.
2) China, India, Japan, Malaysia, and Australia achieved profits exceeding $2k.
3) Pakistan had the most negative profit despite decent sales of $8k.
# Breakdown by Technology category:
1) Australia, China, India, Japan, and Indonesia exceeded the average sales of $23k.
2) China, India, Japan, and Australia achieved profits exceeding $2k.
3) Despite leading in sales, Philippines reported negative profit.


Based on the performance breakdown provided in your dashboard description, here are some recommendations you could consider:
1) Address regions or categories with high sales but negative profits (like Philippines in Furniture and Technology categories).Implement cost control measures or pricing strategies to improve profitability in these regions.
2) Continue to focus on regions performing above average in sales (e.g., Australia, China, India, Japan). Explore opportunities for growth in these regions through targeted marketing or sales initiatives.
3) Gather feedback from customers in regions with varying sales and profit performance. Use customer insights to tailor products or services to local preferences or needs.
4) Streamline operations in regions with negative profit margins despite decent sales (e.g., Philippines, Pakistan). Look for opportunities to reduce costs or improve efficiency in supply chain or distribution channels.
